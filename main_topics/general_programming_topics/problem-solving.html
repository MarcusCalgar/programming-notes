    <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
    <p>To be successful at problem solving, follow these steps:
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Understand the problem</strong>: the first step to be able to solve any problem is to define what the problem actually is. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Write it down in plain text</li>
                    <li>Draw some diagrams if necessary</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Plan</strong>: break down the large problem into manageable smaller ones. Some useful questions are: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Does it have an interface? What will it look like? What functionality will it have?</li>
                    <li>What inputs will the program work with? Does it get it from the user, or from somewhere else?</li>
                    <li>What is the desired output?</li>
                    <li>Given the input, what needs to be done to get the desired output?
                        <br> This is where the algorithm goes. <strong>An algorithm is a kind of recipe to solve a particular problem.</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Write pseudocode</strong>: pseudocode is the logic of the program in natural language. It helps to slow down and give time to really
                think about what the program has to be doing.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Divide and Conquer</strong>: start coding with the smallest and simplest subproblem. <strong>Do NOT</strong> try to solve the big problem in a single go.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>Takeaways:
        <ul>
            <li>Learning to program is hard, because you have to be able to describe what you want to the dumb-as-a-rock computer.</li>
            <li>Write out the concepts first, then convert to code later.
                <ul>
                    <li>A lot of time, the real problem is not understanding the problem well, not not knowing what code to write.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Comments are code.
                <ul>
                    <li>Code explains the comments to the computer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
        </ul>
