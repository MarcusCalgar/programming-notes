    <h1>Clean Code</h1>
    <p>Since programmers read a lot more code than writing it, learning to write clean, easy to read code is very helpful. Not only for other, but also when
        you have to re-read your own code.
    </p>
    <p>Some good advice: 
        <ul>
            <li>Keep consistent indentation. (<code>tab</code> or <code>double space</code>.</li>
            <li>Use semicolons (<code>;</code>) even if the language doesn't require it.</li>
            <li>Keep the line length short. A lot of sources recommend 80 characters.</li>
            <li>The naming of functions and variables should be consistent. Always use camelCase.</li>
            <li>Write explanatory comments, but don't abuse them.</li>
            <li>Avoid large functions.</li>
            <li>Avoid indiscriminate mixing of coding languages. Like mixing CSS and JavaScript within the HTML structure.</li>
            <li>Don't use too many external imports as it will slow down the application.</li>
            <li>Code tells you how, comments tell you why.</li>
        </ul>
