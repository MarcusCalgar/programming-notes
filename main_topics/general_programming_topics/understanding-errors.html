    <h1>Understanding Errors</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>An error is a built in <code>Object</code> in the language. It has crucial information about what and where went wrong during execution.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calling on a variable that has not been declared "throws" a <code>ReferenceError</code>.</li>
        <li>An error has a type and a message and it also tells us in which file the error occurred, on which line.</li>
        <li>The <code>stack trace</code> helps us to understand when was the error thrown. What functions were running, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Common Types of Errors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>SyntaxError</code>: happens when the code isn't written according to the rules of the language.</li>
        <li><code>ReferenceError</code>: happens when a variable hasn't been declared or is misspelled.</li>
        <li><code>TypeError</code>: happens when:
            <ul>
                <li>an operand or argument passed to a function is not the same as the function expects or needs.</li>
                <li>attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed.</li>
                <li>attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way.</li>
            </ul>
            When encountering this error, consider the data types of the elements around, maybe it is not what you expect.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Resolving Errors</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Read the error message carefully, and try to understand it.</li>
        <li>Google the error. Somebody else probably got it already.</li>
        <li>Use the debugger, for example in the Chrome DevTools.</li>
        <li>For simpler errors, use <code>console.log()</code> and other console statements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Errors vs. Warnings</h2>
    <p>While errors immediately crash the running of a program, a warning doesn't. These signal potential problems, though usually not that severe. Nonetheless
        it is recommended to address them if possible.
